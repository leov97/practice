                Tela, Honduras, holds a rich history, notably marked by the construction of the first building of the Tela Railroad Company in 1916, celebrating its centennial in 2016. After local efforts to reclaim this historical site, it is now slated to become a cultural museum. Founded by conquistador Cristóbal de Olid on May 3, 1524, Tela thrived in the late 1800s and early 1900s with a primary focus on banana cultivation, driving economic growth and employment.

            <p>Advancements saw the completion of the picturesque accounting facilities by 1916, situated along what is now known as the coastal boulevard. Once a symbol of prosperity, the building became a national treasure, serving as a significant dock and employment hub after the arrival of the Tela Railroad Company, a Honduran subsidiary of the Fruit Company.</p>
            <p>In 1977, the company relocated administrative offices to the municipality of La Lima, leaving the monumental structure abandoned for several years. In the present day, the Contaduría building has been reclaimed by the municipality of Tela. Mayor Mario Fuentes, alongside dedicated volunteers, undertook cleaning efforts, transforming the iconic structure into a venue for unprecedented events since 2010.</p>
            <p>The ongoing struggle to fully restore the Contaduría persists. Architects and engineers specializing in anthropology and history have certified it for a 100% restoration, with an agreement signed with the Museum of Anthropology and History. Supported by local businesses and anthropology organizations, the building will serve as a historical museum for the Tela Railroad Company, featuring an exhibit room with original pieces from the Honduran Mosquitia region donated by collectors.</p>
            <p>As the Contaduría building commemorates a century of history, its narrative will be shared with future generations through the museum.</p>
